This program is an online replica of the board game Shut the Box, a popular children's tile game. 
The game is played with 9 open tiles, numbered 1-9. A round of the game consists of the player taking one turn to try to shut the box. 
A turn consists of a player repeatedly throwing the dice until he or she cannot continue. Each throw of the dice is taken as follows:
- If 7, 8 and 9 are all covered, the player decides whether to throw one die or two.
- If any of these 3 numbers are still uncovered, the player must use both dice.

The player throws the die or dice into the box and adds the number.
The player must then cover available numbers that add up to the total thrown.
For example, if the total is 8, the player may choose one of the following options:
- 8
- 7 & 1
- 6 & 2
- 5 & 3
- 5 & 2 & 1
- 4 & 3 & 1
  
Assuming that one of the options is available to be played, the player selects one, covers the selected number or numbers and proceeds to throw the dice again.
Play continues until either the player closes all the tiles (has shut the box, in which case they win outright) or
until there are no longer plays that can be made given the player's dice roll, in which case the numbers of the uncovered tiles are added and assigned as the player's score.
